Framework for dot tracker and corruption power for snapshotting, but may be easier to just refresh it on static timers, unless multi-dotting snapshotting is the goal. 

Major additions to settings (currently incomplete as of 4/18/20), planned support for multiple separate rotations for PvP, Raiding, Leveling, Farming, etc.
